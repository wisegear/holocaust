        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        When I started in the mortgage industry in 2000, it was new and interesting and I wanted to learn as much as I could. I had this idea that if 
        I created a blog and wrote about what I learned, it would act as a source of valuable information, mainly for me to refer back to but for others who had an 
        interest.</p>        
        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        But of course, the best-laid plans then get interrupted by work, children coming along, on at least one occasion by complete surprise. So yes, 21 years later 
        here we are, finally built and adding content on a regular basis. Oddly now that my children are all grown up and my wife and I have far less 
        responsibility that has given me the time to do this site. Well, the reality is that COVID more than anything has really provided the opportunity 
        to work from home for so long and the lack of things to do.</p>        
        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        Over the span of my 24 years in the mortgage industry, I have worked for three different lenders, the first for 10 years, the second for a year and 
        I have just seen the 11th anniversary in my current role. During that time I have worked at all levels and in all areas. Head of Arrears and Repossessions, 
        Property Inspection Manager, Technical Mortgage Specialist, and currently a High Net Worth Underwriter. I worked in Sub Prime lending at 
        the height of its popularity and eventual collapse and am currently with a large high street lender.</p>       
        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        So it is fair to say I have experienced a lot and of course, had mortgages myself for both my own home and Buy-to-Let investment property.</p>        
        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        So this blog is very much information both past and present, leveraging on my own work over the past 24 years and trying to keep a handle on current events.</p>        
        <p class="wise1text mb-2">
        I don’t claim to be a professional writer or blogger, so apologize if my at times rambling or opinionated views are at times incoherent 
        but I am sure that will improve with time. Probably shouldn’t have waited over 20 years to do this!</p>
